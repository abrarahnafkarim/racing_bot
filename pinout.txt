To connect four motors to a relay module for controlling a car, you'll need to consider the wiring for both the motors and the relay module. Here's a basic guide on how to connect them:

Motor Connections:

Assuming you have four motors, typically arranged as two pairs (one pair for each side of the car), you'll connect each motor to a relay channel. Each motor typically has two terminals: positive (+) and negative (-).

Connect the positive terminal of each motor to the normally open (NO) terminal of a relay channel.
Connect the negative terminal of each motor to a common ground (GND).
Relay Module Connections:

A relay module consists of multiple relays, each with a common (COM) terminal and a normally open (NO) terminal.

Connect the common (COM) terminal of each relay channel to a power source suitable for your motors (e.g., battery positive).
Connect the normally open (NO) terminal of each relay channel to the positive terminal of a motor.
Connect all the relay module's ground (GND) terminals to the ground (GND) of the power supply.
Here's a basic schematic illustrating the connections:

|     Motor 1 (-)---------|---+----|                     |
|                         |   |    +---------------------+
|                         |   |
|     Motor 2 (+)---------|---|----+ NO (Relay Channel 2)
|     Motor 2 (-)---------|---|----|
|                         |   |    +---------------------+
|                         |   |
|     Motor 3 (+)---------|---|----+ NO (Relay Channel 3)
|     Motor 3 (-)---------|---|----|
|                         |   |    +---------------------+
|                         |   |
|     Motor 4 (+)---------|---|----+ NO (Relay Channel 4)
|     Motor 4 (-)---------|---|----|
|                         |   |    +---------------------+
+-------------------------+   |    |        Power        |
                               +----|      Supply       |
                                    +---------------------+
Ensure that the power supply can provide enough current to drive all the motors simultaneously without overloading. Additionally,
check the voltage ratings of both the motors and the relay module to ensure compatibility. Always refer to the datasheets and
documentation provided with your components for accurate wiring instructions.
